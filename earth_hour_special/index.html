				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">Climate change is expected to impact many aspects of our lives, including the production of one of the world’s favourite morning beverages, coffee. In this talk, I will give an overview of the many challenges coffee producers face as our climate changes, including shifts in growing regions and threats from devastating coffee diseases. I will focus on how farmers are managing these challenges by using and further improving sustainable growing techniques, and how us coffee drinkers can support these practices.<br><br>Stephanie is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences at the University of Toronto. Her research explores the dynamic links between ecosystem processes and multi-species plant traits in biodiverse agricultural systems. Her overall research goal is to help inform sustainable farm design and management practices. Outside of work, she enjoys exploring the arts: visiting art galleries and museums, and taking drawing and ballet classes.

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt">Climate models are essential for making predictions about climate change. They allow scientists to answer the question “what would happen if…?” Unfortunately, the answer is often undesirable, which for some is a strong motivation to ignore or doubt these predictions. It is easy to convince yourself that anyone claiming to predict the future must be untrustworthy, but there are in fact many reasons that model predictions are exceptionally reliable. In this talk, I will discuss how my research contributes to the global effort to ensure that studies based on climate models are accurate. <br><br>Laura is a fourth year PhD candidate in the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto with a collaborative specialization in Environmental Studies. She completed her undergraduate degree in physics at McGill University in 2017. In her spare time, Laura enjoys climbing, skiing, walking her dog, and rewatching Gilmore Girls.

				<div class="postcard__preview-txt"> Climate  warming  is  threatening  the  existence  of  wild  species  and  their 
					populations worldwide. Either populations migrate, alter their behaviour or development, 
					or  rapidly  adapt  by  evolution.  In  this  talk,  I  will  review  how  wild  populations  are 
					responding to climate warming. From my research, I will also show how I exposed 7000 
					mustard plants to either ambient or heated conditions to evaluate the capacity for adaptation 
					to  future  warming.  This  talk  will  dive  into  observations  of  the  natural  world,  as  well  as 
					evolutionary principles that are now recently being considered by conservation 
					practitioners.<br><br>Cameron  So  is  a  PhD  student  in  the  Department  of  Biology  at  McGill  University.  He 
						previously  completed  his  M.Sc  (2020)  in  the  Department  of  Ecology  and  Evolutionary 
						Biology  at  the  University  of  Toronto,  studying  the  capacity  for  adaptation  to  climate 
						warming in an annual field mustard. His current research focuses on conserving plants at-
						risk in Canada. Outside of school, Cameron enjoys hiking, frisbee, and attempting to grow 
						heirloom tomatoes
