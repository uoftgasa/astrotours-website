    "abstract": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the recommendations from the University of Toronto to cancel all discretionary events, we will be postponing AstroTours Earth Hour indefinitely. We hope to schedule Earth Hour for another month. Depending on the duration of this recommendation, we may also have to cancel our planned event on May 7th but we are monitoring the situation and will update our website and social media with that decision when it is finalized. We will continue to host our monthly events after the situation has been managed and the safety of our attendees and volunteers is not jeapordized. In the meantime please wash your hands with soap(for 15 seconds or more) or use hand sanitizer, avoid touching your face, disinfect frequently used surfaces, cough or sneeze into a tissue, and self-isolate if you are feeling unwell. For more information about symptoms and Toronto Public Health services, please see",
