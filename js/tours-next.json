    "abstract": "Fourteen billion years ago, the universe was little more than a cloud of hot hydrogen gas.  I will tell the story of how that cloud of gas evolved into all of the galaxies, stars, and planets we see around us today.  In the process, I’ll explain some of how astronomers study the history of the universe, and how telescopes are secretly time machines that let us look directly into the distant past.  I’ll also talk about some of the great mysteries that remain in this story, and how we’re working in Toronto and elsewhere to solve them.",
    "speakerInfo": "Patrick Breysse is a Postdoctoral Fellow studying cosmology at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.  He received his Ph.D. from the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University.  Patrick’s research focuses on a new way of mapping the distant universe which can watch the earliest stars form, study how the universe evolves, and look for new physics beyond standard models.  He also plays the euphonium (kind of a small tuba), and enjoys hiking and science fiction novels.",
