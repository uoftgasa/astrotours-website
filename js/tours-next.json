    "abstract": "Magnetism is one of the fundamental forces of nature and shows up in many places in our daily lives, but itâ€™s not something that most people associate with astronomy. Yet the entire universe is filled with magnetic fields on all scales: from planets to stars to galaxies to galaxy clusters and beyond. In this talk we will take a look at the magnetic universe: the nature of magnetism, the causes of magnetism in astronomical objects, how we detect magnetism in distant places, and how magnetic fields affect our understanding of astrophysics.",
    "speakerInfo" :"Dr. Cameron Van Eck is a research associate at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics. He completed his PhD at Radboud University in the Netherlands in 2017. His research focuses on the study of magnetic fields in the Milky Way and other galaxies, through the use of radio astronomy data. Outside of work he enjoys all things nerdy: Dungeons & Dragons, computer games, sci-fi novels, and more.",
