    "abstract": "Experiments in astronomy have improved enough in recent years for us to have a profound understanding of the Universe's origin and evolution, but what happens when scientists' results conflict with each other? The measurement of the current expansion rate of the Universe is one such source of 'tensions' in modern astronomy. In this public talk, I will guide you through a journey of drama, excitement, and grief as we walk through the history of this scientific debacle.",
    "speakerInfo" :"I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. I first started graduate school with a deep hatred for statistics, but now all of my research is deeply rooted in the application of statistical methods for cosmology. In my spare time, I like taking naps, playing RPG video games, and talking about how much I want a cat.",
