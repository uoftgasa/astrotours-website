    "abstract": "Women and gender minorities have been doing astronomy for centuries but often their contributions are under acknowledged. In celebration of the International day for Women and Girls in STEM, we will be learning about several women and their contributions to astronomy. Their discoveries span everything from the movement of stars in galaxies, to the physics of stars, and the study of planets inside and outside the solar system.",
    "speakerInfo": "Taylor is starting her fourth year as a PhD Candidate in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. She did her undergraduate degree at Quest University Canada in British Columbia where she studied physics and astronomy. When she isn't doing astronomy, she spends her time backpacking, paddling, climbing, and taking care of her rescue dog, Shanty.",
