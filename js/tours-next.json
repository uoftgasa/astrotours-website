    "abstract": "Graduate students from across disciplines at the University of Toronto will share their research in areas affected by or directly involving climate change for our annual Earth Hour event. We have speakers coming from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Physics, and Physical and Environmental Sciences. Following the talks we will have interactive astronomy demos and activities as well as telescope viewing. Come think about sustainability and climate science with the AstroTours team!",
    "speakerInfo": "Our speakers are Cameron So, Laura Saunders, and Stephanie Gagliardi. Cameron studies adaptive potential of a field mustard in response to climate change and is from the Department Of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Laura Saunders, from the Department of Physics, studies ozone-depleting halogenated gases such as chlorofluorocarbons. Stephanie Gagliardi studies a dominant coffee pathogen that is expected to thrive in a warming climate. Stephanie is from the Department of Physical and Environmental Sciences at University of Toronto, Scarborough. ",
