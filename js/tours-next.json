    "abstract": "For the talks, we have three speakers and we wanted to reach out to you on how you think would be the best way to fit the three speaker details on the website. We have a talk title, abstract, speaker image, and background image for each of their talks and I'm not sure what would be the best way to accommodate enough information. The goal is to show that there is an overarching theme (Earth Hour) but different speakers for the talk portion of the event. Sending you all the speaker details shortly, feel free to suggest what you think would be best!",
