On the first Thursday of most months, the Astronomy Public Tours – the AstroTours – are held by the graduate students in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. All of our events are free and no registration or sign-up is required.

We bring to you the hottest discoveries of modern astrophysics, the life and times of astronomers past, and the science behind blockbuster films and science fiction. Our talks are meant for a diverse audience, and we try to keep the technical aspects of them to a degree understandable to those with a high school science background.

While the lecture halls for our public talks are wheelchair accessible, unfortunately this is not the case for all of the activities after the talk. Please check our [FAQ](../faq/) for more details and contact us if you have further questions.
