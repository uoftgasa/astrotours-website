abstract: "The human endeavour to understand the universe has been a collective project spanning recorded history. It has enticed nations and tribes across continents and millennia. Notably, classical Islamic civilizations around the world have been awestruck by the inner workings of the cosmos and have made discoveries critical to how we understand the universe today. In this talk, we will explore stories of astronomical discovery from across the classical Islamic world and how they set the stage for the research we conduct today as a part of our collective scientific heritage."
