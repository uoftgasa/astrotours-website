abstract: Known as the most powerful magnets in the universe, magnetars are one of the most mysterious objects in space. Formed after the death of a star, magnetars use these powerful magnetic fields to emit a wide range of signals that can be seen across the galaxy. Understanding these emission processes requires understanding physics over a wide range of sizes and strengths. In this talk, I will cover how we can simplify these physics to model magnetars in simulations, and match the signals that we observe.
speakerInfo: Jonathan is a 5th year PhD candidate in the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto, and works at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. His research includes modelling the plasma around magnetars, and characterizing signals of dark matter with new interactions. Originally from Vancouver, Jonathan completed his undergrad in physics and mathematics at the University of British Columbia. When not studying physics, he can be found lifting heavy objects in mercifully air-conditioned spaces.
