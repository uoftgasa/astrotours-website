abstract: New telescopes are generating more data than astronomers could examine in a thousand lifetimes. The Vera Rubin Observatory will soon image the entire southern sky every few nights, flagging millions of changes that might be new supernovae, asteroids, or phenomena never seen before. The Euclid Space Telescope is imaging over a billion galaxies, including those displaying gravitational lensing and tidal streams, where larger galaxies have ripped apart smaller ones. AI has become an essential tool for keeping up with the incoming data, and we'll look at how it is used to reveal these "needles in the haystack". We'll also discuss where AI falls short, and why astronomers still need to be in the loop. If you've ever wondered whether AI is genuinely useful or pure hype, you'll leave with a clear answer.
speakerInfo: Nolan Koblischke is a PhD candidate in Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. His research is on using AI to make sense of astronomy data, and is currently focused on finding faint tidal streams in massive galaxy image catalogues. Nolan is passionate about ensuring that no discovery goes missed when there's too much data and too few astronomers. He grew up near Kelowna, BC, and outside of research spends his time watching movies and debating whether to return to BC for the skiing.
