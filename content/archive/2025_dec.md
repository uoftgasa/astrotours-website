abstract: "Our everyday perception of light is limited to the visible radiation, which is only a small segment of the vast electromagnetic spectrum, that spans from high-energy waves as X-rays, UV and visible waves to low-energy radio/millimetre waves. The phenomena and physical effects we can observe fundamentally change depending on the frequency band used. In this contribution, a comparison between science achievable in the higher-frequency bands with that of the lower-frequency regime will be made, detailing on how the instrumentation required for observations dramatically changes, contrasting the design of traditional optical telescopes with the engineering of large radio telescopes and arrays. In addition, the unique scientific cases addressed by the latter will be discussed, as studying large-scale structures of the Cosmic Web and extracting crucial cosmological information from the observation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in order to establish a cosmological model that will fully describe the Universe."
speakerInfo: "Eleonora Barbavara is a PhD student in Astronomy, Astrophysics, and Space Science at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. Her work is divided between instrumentation, observational strategy development and integration of MISTRAL, a new high angular resolution millimeter camera at the Sardinia Radio Telescope, and data analysis of galaxy clusters. As a member of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory (SO) collaborations, Eleonora analyzes data to investigate the nature of the Cosmic Web, and also to search for the Anomalous Microwave Background in both galactic and extragalactic sources."
