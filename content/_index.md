    abstract: Recreating your object of study in a lab experiment serves as excellent testing grounds for any scientific theory and is a staple of most sciences. But what do you do if your object of study is an extremely large, immensely hot ball of radiating gas that is near impossible to recreate in a lab on Earth? Well, you can just make a computer model of it! This talk is a handy guide for the rookie scientist and science enthusiast — it will walk you through the basics of making a star from scratch.  This guide is your peek into the world of modelling and simulations and how they contribute to cutting edge astronomy research.
    speakerInfo: Eesha Das Gupta is a PhD student at the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. She works on making computer simulations of stars to study how they rotate and how they would interact with companion stars. Eesha previously received her Bachelor’s degree in physics from Drexel University in Philadelphia. In her free time Eesha enjoys reading, drawing, and introducing people to niche subcultures.
