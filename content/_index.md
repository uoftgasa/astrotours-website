    abstract: "What if we could hear the universe? Gravitational waves, tiny ripples in space and time, allow us to do just that. Albert Einstein predicted their existence over a century ago, but it’s only in the last decade that we’ve been able to detect them directly. These waves carry unique clues about some of the most extreme events in the universe: colliding black holes, merging neutron stars, and more.
We’ll journey from the first principles of gravitational waves to the extraordinary technology used to detect them. But detection is just the beginning. We’ll then explore how to decode information from these cosmic messages using modern data science, including tools like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Neural Networks. We’ll end by sharing a glimpse into my own research, where I used these methods to better understand the role gravitational waves play in teaching us about the history and evolution of our universe. Whether you’re a space enthusiast or just curious about the cutting edge of science, this talk offers a window into how we are listening to the universe in an entirely new way."
    speakerInfo: "Utkarsh Mali (he/him) is a 3rd year PhD Student at the Department of Physics, the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, and a Junior Fellow at Massey College. His research focuses on analyzing gravitational waves to reveal the properties of colliding black holes and neutron stars. Outside of academia, Utkarsh enjoys hiking, playing ultimate frisbee, and traveling new places."
