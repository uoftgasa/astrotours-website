    abstract: The Pan-African School for Emerging Astronomers (PASEA) is a short course in astronomy for university students and teachers from across Africa, designed and taught by a collaboration of astronomers from Africa, North America and Australia. Our goals include building a critical mass of astronomers across Africa, and exchanging ideas about teaching and learning between Africa and abroad. PASEA started in West Africa in 2013, where it was known as WAISSYA, and has held four times in Nigeria and Ghana. 2022 was an exciting year for PASEA, as we expanded to become a Pan-African program, and held our first school in southern Africa in Zambia in October. We also held our first online program for PASEA alumni on remote observing, programming, and data science. In this talk, Iâ€™ll highlight some of the activities in the school, our successes and lessons learned, and ideas for the next school.
    speakerInfo: Margaret Ikape is a PhD candidate in the department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Toronto. Having attended PASEA in past years, she is now a PASEA undergraduate stream instructor. She also helped organise the PASEA mentorship program, a platform to connect PASEA students with professional astronomers around the world. Her interest in astronomy started at a very young age and that interest has been sustained by the numerous unknowns in the universe. Her current work tries to understand the nature of the early universe using simulated data.
