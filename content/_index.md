    abstract: For the first time in decades, Eastern and Atlantic Canada will find themselves cast beneath the shadow of the Moon on April 8, 2024. As the Moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, it will create a total solar eclipse, completely blocking the Sun from view for a few spectacular minutes. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime event for Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces, as the next total solar eclipse over eastern Canada will be in 2079, and 2106 after that! Toronto is unfortunately not in the path of totality, but will instead be treated to a spectacular partial solar eclipse. This talk will provide key safety information for observing the Sun and eclipses safely, the science behind eclipses, and how you can engage yourself and your community with the eclipse.
