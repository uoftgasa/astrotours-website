    abstract: Our Sun, the vital source of energy that sustains life on Earth, can also serve as a key to understanding the plasma-filled universe around us. Starting with insights from solar physics and laboratory plasmas, we can unravel the fundamental mechanisms that govern plasma behaviour and apply them to various astrophysical contexts. From advanced space probes to sophisticated computational models, we'll discuss the tools that help us decode the plasma dynamics shaping the environment of our Sun, along with the environments of neutron stars, black holes, and the broader universe.
    speakerInfo: Tanisha Ghosal (she/her) is a graduate student in the Department of Physics at the University of Toronto, working at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics. She completed her undergraduate degree in Physics & Astronomy at the University of Waterloo and currently works with numerical simulations to simulate astrophysical plasmas. Outside of research, she enjoys watching movies, walking around the city, and reading Wikipedia articles!
