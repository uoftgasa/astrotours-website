    abstract: 
    speakerInfo: Simran Nerval (she/her) is a PhD candidate at The Dunlap Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics and The David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. She studies a time period known as inflation, the exponential expansion of the universe within a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. She uses a combination of theory, computer simulations, and data analysis to determine constraints on inflationary models. Simran received her Honours Bachelor of Science in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Toronto and her Master of Science in Astroparticle Physics and Cosmology from Queenâ€™s University. Alongside her research, she works on various outreach and EDI initiatives including coding and astronomy camps for high school students with Coding the Cosmos in order to promote enthusiasm for science in youth and advocate for diversity. In her free time, she is an aspiring baker, baking everything from loaves of bread to decorated cakes!
