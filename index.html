        <hr>
        <p>On the first Thursday of most months, the Astronomy Public Tours &ndash; the AstroTours &ndash; are held by the graduate students in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. All of our events are free and no registration or sign-up is required.</p>
        <p>We bring to you the hottest discoveries of modern astrophysics, the life and times of astronomers past, and the science behind blockbuster films and science fiction. Our talks are meant for a diverse audience, and we try to keep the technical aspects of them to a degree understandable to those with a high school science background.</p>

            <h4>What happens during an AstroTour?</h4>
            <p>The regular tour begins with an hour-long lecture starting at 8pm in winter and 9pm in summer. This is followed by a brief question period, and then the volunteers will lead you over to the post-talk activities in the McLennan Physical Labs building (MP). Telescope operators will be stationed at the 15th and 16th floors of the MP building. On clear evenings, it is possible to view many different celestial objects such as planets and nebulae through our telescopes. In case of cloudy weather, we will still show you the telescopes and describe their setup and operation. Concurrent to our telescope tour, we hold planetarium shows, in which we take you on a virtual tour of our solar system and beyond in our 25-seat inflatable planetarium. Additional stations that we typically run are the World Wide Telescope, Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, and 3D printed model telescopes. Special Tours (e.g. Earth Hour and our Keynote talk) are run differently than the regular monthly AstroTour, and will be described on the main page when they are upcoming.</p>
            <h4>Where are the AstroTours located, and how do I get there?</h4>
            <p>The address of the lecture location for the upcoming AstroTour, as well as a map, can be found on the “Location” section of this webpage. This address varies so please be sure to check! The post-lecture activities are always held at McLennan Physical Labs, 60 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 3H4. If you are attending the talk, the volunteers will walk groups over to McLennan after the talk concludes. If you are only attending the later activities, you will see signs for AstroTours from any entrance of McLennan.</p>
            <h4>What time should I show up?</h4>
            <p>The lecture begins at 8pm in winter and 9pm in summer. We open the doors approximately 15 minutes prior to the show. Free planetarium tickets are available at the lecture doors before you walk in.</p>
            <h4>Is there a fee for AstroTours?</h4>
            <p>No! All parts of AstroTours are free, since they are run by volunteer graduate students from the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at UofT.</p>
            <h4>Do I need to register for the AstroTours?</h4>
            <p>No! There is no registration for any portion of AstroTours. You can just show up the night of the event.</p>
            <h4>What kind of science background do I need to attend the talk?</h4>
            <p>The lectures for the most part are delivered at an Ontario science grade 9/10 level, with some additional details being aimed at a more advanced audience. Our speakers try to avoid jargon and present more advanced concepts with helpful visuals to go along.</p>
            <h4>Are the AstroTours appropriate for children?</h4>
            <p>We leave it up to parents and guardians to determine if children in their group will enjoy attending the talk. Depending on the science background of the child, the lectures may be suitable for children at a middle school level and should be suitable to most people above grade 9. The observing sessions and planetarium shows are fun and interesting for children of all ages. However, if your child is unable to sit still for an hour or gets tired early, it might be best not to bring them to the Tour.</p>
            <h4>Can I bring a large group to the AstroTours?</h4>
            <p>School classes, cub scouts and other large groups often attend our lectures. If you are bringing more than five people to the tour, then it might be a good idea to arrive 15 to 20 minutes early to ensure that everyone can sit together. If you are worried that your group is too large, please contact us.</p>
            <p>At this time we are not accepting groups of more than five people for regularly scheduled planetarium shows. On occasion, however, our planetarium operators have volunteered to do an extra show for groups with between 10 and 25 people. Please contact us to see if this may be the case for the upcoming AstroTour.</p>
            <p>The planetarium can be booked for private groups, however AstroTours does not administer this service. For more information, go to <a href="universe.utoronto.ca">Universe</a> or contact Universe’s planetarium service at <a href="mailto:planetarium@universe.utoronto.ca">planetarium&#64;universe.utoronto.ca</a>.</p>
            <h4>Can I have a private tour?</h4>
            <p>We do not offer free private tours. If you are interested in a private tour of the planetarium and telescopes, please go to <a href="universe.utoronto.ca">Universe</a> or contact Universe’s planetarium service at <a href="mailto:planetarium@universe.utoronto.ca">planetarium&#64;universe.utoronto.ca</a>.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in attending hour-long planetarium shows as an individual or small group, <a href="universe.utoronto.ca">Universe</a> now offers paid public shows.</p>
            <h4>Where can I find information and video of past talks?</h4>
            <p>Videos of past talks can be found on the talks’ respective web page in the Archive. You can also find the vast majority of the past talks we recorded on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/UofTAstroTours">Youtube Channel</a>.</p>
            <h4>I can’t attend the talks on Thursdays. Are there other events I can attend?</h4>
            <p>Yes! There are many astronomy events in Toronto other than our regular AstroTour events, often for free. AstroTours occasionally host special events, such as the Keynote Lecture, which happen on other days of the week. We recommend <a href="https://universe.utoronto.ca/contact/sign-up-for-event-updates/">signing up for the Event Horizon newsletter</a> to find out about astronomy events in Toronto. Please note that we do not administer this newsletter, so we can’t answer any related questions.</p>
            <p>The <a href="astro.utoronto.ca">Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</a>, the <a href="dunlap.utoronto.ca">Dunlap Institute</a>, and the <a href="cita.utoronto.ca">Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics</a> run many outreach events across the city of Toronto and around the year. Their collective outreach website, <a href="universe.utoronto.ca">Universe</a>, offers a number of services, including Ask-an-Astronomer and paid public planetarium shows. Members of the department give lectures at various branches of the Toronto Public Library. Please check the <a href="https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/programs-and-classes/categories/science-technology.jsp">Toronto Public Library Science &amp; Technology event calendar</a> for more details. The three institutes will also hold special events to celebrate major astronomical events; check out their respective websites for details.</p>
            <p>For even more astronomy-related activities, please check out our partners’ websites. The <a href="https://rascto.ca/">RASC</a> and <a href="http://asx.sa.utoronto.ca/">ASX</a> in particular host regular public lectures and telescope viewing nights.</p>
            <h4>Are the facilities for the AstroTours wheelchair accessible?</h4>
            <p>The accessibility of the talk venue will depend on the lecture hall. Detailed information regarding accessibility can be found on the <a href="https://ace.utoronto.ca/">University of Toronto’s Academic and Campus Events website</a>, under “Room Info”.</p>
            <p>If the lecture is held in Room 1060 of Bahen Centre, we will note that none of the lecture hall entrances have push/power plates for opening the doors. There is seating available at the same level as the entrances, however. Please ask one of our volunteers about propping open the doors.</p>
            <p>The activities after the lecture are held in McLennan Physical Laboratories, which unfortunately has limited wheelchair accessibility. Some of our activities are held on the main level, but the telescope observing is held on the 15th and 16th floors and requires taking stairs from the 14th floor. The planetarium is located in the basement of the Astronomy Building, which unfortunately is not wheelchair accessible.</p>
            <p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:tours@astro.utoronto.ca">tours&#64;astro.utoronto.ca</a> if you have further questions regarding accessibility.</p>
            <h4>Do you have a newsletter?</h4>
            <p>No, we do not have a newsletter. We recommend <a href="https://universe.utoronto.ca/contact/sign-up-for-event-updates/">signing up for the Event Horizon newsletter</a> to find out about astronomy events in Toronto. Please note that we do not administer this newsletter, so we can’t answer any related questions.</p>
            <h4>How do I find out about your events?</h4>
            <p>We advertise all of our events on our social media accounts. Please follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram! We also post our upcoming event on our website, and send our event details to the Event Horizon newsletter. Please note that we do not administer this newsletter, so we can’t answer any related questions.</p>
            <h4>Will I be able to look through the telescopes?</h4>
            <p>Unfortunately, telescope observing is weather&ndash;dependent. As a general rule&ndash;of&ndash;thumb, if you can’t see any stars by eye (e.g. if it’s cloudy), we will not be able to do any observing. Cloudy skies are the most common reason we are unable to observe, but we may also have difficulty observing if it is very cold or very windy. If we are unable to look through the telescopes, we still offer a tour of our observatory to show people the telescopes and how they work.</p>
            <h4>What will I be able to see through the telescopes?</h4>
            <p>The telescope targets are different every month and depend on what is visible in the sky that night. Some examples of telescope targets in the past are the Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, stellar nurseries, double stars, and star clusters. Please ask one of our volunteers if you would like to know what is being observed.</p>
            <h4>Will I be able to attend a planetarium show?</h4>
            <p>Due to limited seating, we offer free tickets to our planetarium shows on a first-come first-served basis. These tickets are available outside of the lecture hall before the talk. If you are a family with young children, please ask one of our volunteers about obtaining tickets to the first planetarium show.</p>
            <h4>What happens during a planetarium show?</h4>
            <p>Our 15-minute planetarium shows are different every month and are usually designed by our planetarium presenter to go along with the lecture. They usually begin by looking at the night sky as we can see it from Toronto, and continue by exploring our Solar System or beyond. Additionally, the content in the planetarium shows is often more accessible to broader audiences than the content in our lectures.</p>
            <h4>What types of interactive media do you offer?</h4>
            <p>We usually offer the World Wide Telescope, which allows you to explore the Solar System using an Xbox Kinect Motion Sensor. We also have an Oculus Rift, which allows you to explore the Solar System, the universe, and other cosmic scenes through virtual reality. Additionally, we have 3D-printed models of spacecraft exploring our Solar System and astronomical telescopes.</p>

            <p>We would like to acknowledge this sacred land on which the University of Toronto operates. It has been a site of human activity for 15,000 years. This land is the territory of the <strong>Huron&ndash;Wendat</strong> and <strong>Petun First Nations</strong>, the <strong>Seneca</strong>, and most recently, the <strong>Mississaugas of the Credit River</strong>. The territory was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Iroquois Confederacy and Confederacy of the Ojibwe and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. Today, the meeting place of Toronto is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work in the community, on this territory.</p>
